        <p class="long">Ballet is the foundation of all dance styles, you don’t have to take this class but we do strongly encourage everyone to take ballet as the technique delivered within these classes improves a students technical ability and they 
        progress much quicker regardless of preferred dance style.</p>
       
      
        <div class="quote"><p>"I love ballet, it’s helped me improve my technique so much and I love that our teacher uses regular songs and 
        not just classical music, it makes it more fun"</p>

      <div class= jazz>
      <h2>Jazz</h2>
      <p class="short">This style combines techniques of classical 
      ballet and modern dance with the current forms of popular

      <p class="long">Our jazz classes are very upbeat and fun 
      with lots of technique to improve your dancing, the class
      has a mixture of kicks, leaps, turns and a small routine 
      to get the students use to picking up quickly but more 
      importantly accurately.</p>
      <div class="quote"><p>“Jazz is the best! I always look forward to learning new 
      combinations and improving my turns, I couldn’t even do 
      a turn when I first started!”</p>

      and interpretative body movements.</p>
      <img src="./images/tap.jpg" width="150" height="100"/>
      <p class="long">Tap class is a wonderful way to teach the 
      students to hear beats and learn to move with the rhythm,
      again more up to date music is used to create the beats with 
      the feet and a little routine to get creative.</p>
      <div class="quote"><p>“Tap has helped me improve my musicality 
      so much, having to listen carefully to the music and understand 
      when and how to move my feet has helped with all the other 
      dance classes I do”</p>

          <p class="long"></p>
          <div class="quote"><p>“Before starting stretch & tech I couldn’t even 
          touch my toes nevermind anything else, now I can do the splits 
          which means higher kicks, it’s helped with my back flexibility 
          which means I can be more graceful in ballet and it’s helping 
          me build up strength in my feet ready for pointework, it’s 
          tough at times but it’s so worth it!”</p>

          <div class= comp>
            <h2>Competition Troupe</h2>
            <p class="short">Dance routines that are learned with the aim of performing 
              them competitively</p>
              <img src="./images/comp.jpg" width="300" height="200"/>
              <p class="long">This class is open to anyone, most schools will only 
                let students at a certain level compete or they have to do 
                a set amount of classes,or have been a student for a set 
                amount of years. We don’t do that, when we say it’s for everyone 
                we mean it!
    
              <div class="quote"><p>“Competition class helps me put everything 
                I've learned in technqiue classes into practice. I love that 
                competitions are for everyone not just supposed elite dancers, 
                everyone gets a chance to compete”</p>

                <h2>Performance Troupe</h2>
                <p class="short">Dance routines that are learned with the aim of performing 
                  them at events</p>
                  <img src="./images/perform.jpg" width="300" height="200"/>
                  <p class="long">Performance troupe is very similar to our competition troupe, in that 
                  students will learn routines to perform on stage. The only 
                  difference is that these are not for competitions, they are 
                  to give students the chance to perform in front of an 
                  audience without the competitive pressure. It's also ideal 
                  for those thinking of doing competitions who want to try 
                  out performing first or who are not ready/able to travel 
                  around the country competing.
        
                  <div class="quote"><p>“I really enjoy having the chance to perform, 
                  I enjoy dancing at our local fetes but also when we go to 
                  places like Disneyland to perform!”</p>
